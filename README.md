# Wine-Quality-Prediction
The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.

1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict wine quality using classification models such as Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The dataset includes chemical qualities of wine, which are analyzed to determine their relationship with wine quality scores.

2. Objectives
Utilize multiple classifier models for wine quality prediction.Analyze chemical features to identify key predictors of quality.Visualize patterns and trends in wine data for better understanding.

3. Steps Performed
a. Classifier Models:
Implemented and trained Random Forest, SGD Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).Tuned hyperparameters for improved model accuracy.Compared performance of models using classification metrics.
b. Chemical Qualities:
Analyzed features such as density, acidity, alcohol, and pH as predictors.Checked correlations between features and wine quality labels.
c. Data Analysis Libraries:
Used Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis.Used NumPy for array operations and numerical computations.
d. Data Visualization:
Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore feature distributions and correlations.Plotted confusion matrices to evaluate classification performance.

4. Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook for code execution and visualization.

5. Outcomes
Trained and evaluated multiple classification models for wine quality prediction.
